- 👋 Hi, I’m Ashita
- I'm a passionate learner interested in both Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and Web Development. Here's a bit about me:-
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring the intersection of DSA and Web Development, finding efficient algorithms to solve real-world problems in web applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms to strengthen my problem-solving skills and mastering technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React.js for Web Development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve implementing DSA concepts in web applications or building responsive and interactive websites.
